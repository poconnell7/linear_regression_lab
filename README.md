# Linear Regression Lab

## These are the files for the Linear Regression Lab

There should be a starter file for the students, and an instructor/solutions file.

The lab that the students will do will take about 20 minutes.
Introducing the lab should take about 15 minutes.

The instructor will start off with a quick review of Linear Regression.
Then we will import the red wine data.  
(The white wine data will be used by the students later during the lab itself.)  

We will discuss the data science process.
The instructor will then do the Exploratory Data Analysis for the red wine data.
We will also cover the correlation of the different features, in particular with respect to quality.  

Finally we will cover Train Test Split in class, before the students begin their lab.
They can repeat these steps for the white wine data, before doing the linear regresssion themselves.
