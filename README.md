# Linear Regression Lab

There is a setup/starter file, and an instructor/solutions file.

The lab that the students will do will take about 20 minutes.  
Introducing the lab should take about 15 minutes.

The instructor will start off with a quick review of Linear Regression.  
Then we will import the red wine data.  
(The white wine data will be used by the students later during the lab itself.)  

We will discuss the data science process.
The instructor will then do the Exploratory Data Analysis for the red wine data.

The student lab will then start after the EDA in the notebook.

The lab can use the white wine data and repeat the EDA steps.  
The lab will cover the correlation of the different features, in particular with respect to quality.  

Train Test Split will be used to create training and test sets, before doing the linear regresssion.
